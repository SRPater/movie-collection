# Movie Collection

A handy CLI tool to keep track of a movie collection. I wrote this as my first personal project for Boot.dev's Backend Develoer Path.

## Running the program

First, make sure the `collection/movies.json` file is in the root directory of the program. If not, just add an empty file. Then, run the following command:

`python3 main.py`
